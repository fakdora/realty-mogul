# Realty Mogul 

Live demo is on Heroku:
https://rm-data-display-react.herokuapp.com/

## To run
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Technologies
* React
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction) 
  - Used grid layout to display data in equally divided columns
  - Used icons
* Redux 
  - Didn't really need redux as main Data is from a static file, but
    mapped main component to redux state changes to show what it should do in normal situations.
